<h1>The Best Books According to Me </h1>
<h2>My top 3 books of all time</h2>
<hr>
<h3>Kite Runner</h3>
<p>Sad and wholesome. Was quite depressing but good nevertheless.</p>
<h3>The Seven Husbands of Evelyn Hugo</h3>
<p>Everyone should read this. Classic.</p>
<h3>Origin</h3>
<p>Haven't actually finished reading it. Like it pretty far though.</p>
